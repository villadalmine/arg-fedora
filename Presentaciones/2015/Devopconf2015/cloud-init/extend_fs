    Run $ sudo fdisk -l to find name of your new disk (e.g., /dev/vdb)

    Open /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup in an editor

    Add the new disk by creating a DEVS entry. If you added more than one, you can add more to the list separated by a space.

    DEVS="/dev/vdb"

    If you’d like to use some of the space on the new disk to grow the root volume, you can create a ROOT_SIZE with the new total size.

    ROOT_SIZE=4G

    Run $ sudo docker-storage-setup to run the helper script and configure the thin pool. This tool calculates the amount of available space, what’s needed for the metadata pool, and executes the LVM commands.

    Run $ sudo docker info to make sure that the Docker daemon sees the added space.

    If you added space to the root volume, run $ sudo xfs_growfs / to make sure the filesystem gets expanded to match the volume size.

    If you added space to the root volume, run df -Th to make sure that the root volume has been grown to the new total size.
